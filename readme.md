# The Labyrinth of Shell Scripts 

# SQL Backup to Github
Within this repository lies a potent elixir - a bash script that bridges the chasm between the sacred data of your MySQL and the hallowed halls of your GitHub repository. Its incantation (detailed below) allows you to weave a protective spell around your database, safeguarding it within the digital fortress of Git.

## The Ritual

1. **Unleash the Script:**  Forge a copy of the script (dubbed "sql_to_git.sh") onto your server.
2. **Gather the Ingredients:**  Provide the script with the incantations for:
   - **MySQL Username** (the key to your database)
   - **MySQL Password** (the secret safeguard)
   - **Database Name** (the vessel holding your precious data)
   - **GitHub Username** (your digital alias)
   - **GitHub Personal Access Token** (a powerful token granting access, **treat it with reverence!**)
   - **Backup Directory** (a temporary haven for the data)
3. **Invoke the Spell:**  With focused intent, execute the script (./sql_to_git.sh). Witness the mystical flow of data as it transcends the boundaries, seeking refuge within the GitHub repository.
